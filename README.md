Archery Clash Cheats remove ads mod menu Hacks tips - The Diamond Wheel requires 10 gemstones to play, and you can win gold coins (much more than the Free Wheel), health, and even arrows and bows. The luxury wheels are priced at $4.99 and offer some truly heavyweight players as prizes, including the Matthews Monster Hunt, the best bow in the game with a power of+251% and a pumping speed of+152%. The value of free spins is not as good as watching advertisements for free daily coins, and other rewards are also difficult to obtain. Therefore, if your time is limited, my suggestion is to first watch the advertisement to obtain all daily coins, and then consider playing free spins. The game cost of Advanced Wheel is $1.99, and you can win some great prizes in it, including a great bow and up to 50 gems.
